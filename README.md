# Cops and Robber
The game of Cops and Robber is a pursuit game on graph. Given a set of vertices, some of them connected by edges (i.e. a **graph**), the cop chooses a start vertice, so as the robber. Then, each player can move to adjacent vertex, until (maybe) the cop land on the same vertice as the robber.
This code gives a way to test the game with your favorite graphs.

The game runs with [**pygame libray**](https://www.pygame.org/news).  

You can choose the number of cops, and the number of rounds (so that the robber can win), clicking on the small gear in the top right of the window. Then you just have to click on the number (it should starts flashing), and select the number of your choice with your keyboard.  

Finally, you can choose a graph among 9 differents graph, with the 'Select Graph' menu. Note that the selected graph is the one that will be open in the graph editor.
