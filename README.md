# cops_robber
The game of cops and robber is a pursuit game on graph. Given a set of vertices, some of them connected by edges (i.e. a **graph**), the cop chooses a start vertice, so as the robber. Then, each player can move to adjacent vertex, until (maybe) the cop land on the same vertice as the robber.
