# Cops and Robber
The game of Cops and Robber is a pursuit game on graph. Given a set of vertices, some of them connected by edges (i.e. a **graph**), the cop chooses a start vertice, so as the robber. Then, each player can move to adjacent vertex, until (maybe) the cop land on the same vertice as the robber.
This code gives a way to test your favorite graphs. It contains a graph editor. You can choose the number of cops, and the number of rounds (so that the robber could win).
